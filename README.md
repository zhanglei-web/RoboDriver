# RoboDriver

## Overview

RoboDriver is the core driver-layer component of DataCollect and serves as the standardized robot access module within the [CoRobot](https://github.com/FlagOpen/CoRobot) data stack.

As shown above, RoboDriver acts as the device-side driver adaptation layer. [RoboDriver-Server](https://github.com/FlagOpen/RoboDriver-Server) is the data/control bridge layer and channel router, and [RoboXStudio](https://ei2data.baai.ac.cn/home) is the cloud- or platform-side console and data management center.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Robot Integration Methods**: RoboDriver supports integration beyond SDKs, including ROS and Dora.
- **LeRobot Compatibility**: RoboDriver's robot interface directly uses LeRobot's `Robot` class, which means RoboDriver and LeRobot are mutually compatible.
- **Enhanced LeRobot Dataset Format**: Different data structures are used at different stages of data handling. Data is stored as individual entries at the collection end for easier editing and transmission. The format also extends the original LeRobot specification.

## Quick Start

Please refer to the project documentation: [RoboDriver-Doc](https://flagopen.github.io/RoboDriver-Doc)
