# RoboDriver

## Overview

RoboDriver is the core driver-layer component of DataCollect and serves as the standardized robot access module within the [CoRobot](https://github.com/FlagOpen/CoRobot) data stack.

</p>

As shown above, RoboDriver acts as the device-side driver adaptation layer. [RoboDriver-Server](https://github.com/FlagOpen/RoboDriver-Server) is the data/control bridge layer and channel router, and [RoboXStudio](https://ei2data.baai.ac.cn/home) is the cloud- or platform-side console and data management center.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Robot Integration Methods**: RoboDriver supports integration beyond SDKs, including ROS and Dora.
- **LeRobot Compatibility**: RoboDriver's robot interface directly uses LeRobot's `Robot` class, which means RoboDriver and LeRobot are mutually compatible.
- **Enhanced LeRobot Dataset Format**: Different data structures are used at different stages of data handling. Data is stored as individual entries at the collection end for easier editing and transmission. The format also extends the original LeRobot specification.

## Quick Start

Please refer to the project documentation: [RoboDriver-Doc](https://flagopen.github.io/RoboDriver-Doc)

## Simulation Examples

Considering the various uncertainties of robots in real-world environments, we recommend that you first try using `RoboDriver` with the `simulation examples` we provide.

RoboDriver has completed adaptation for the `Genesis` simulation environment. Adaptation for environments like `mujoco` and `isaac sim` is under development. For usage, please refer to the project documentation and the `README` in the corresponding folders within the repository.

## Robot Examples
RoboDriver has completed adaptation for multiple mainstream robots. Examples by integration method are as follows (each repository contains complete guidelines for the corresponding robot's integration steps, environment configuration, command adaptation, etc.):

> ✨ Notes:
> 1. Integration method naming convention: `robodriver-robot-[robot model]-[teleoperation method]-[integration type]` (e.g., `aio`/`follower`/`teleoperate`, `ros2`/`dora`);
> 2. Each adaptation repository contains **complete integration guidelines including environment setup, configuration modifications, and collection/control verification**;
> 3. Continuously adding adapted robots; please follow this list or project updates.

We warmly welcome community developers to contribute implementations for more robots! You can participate in the following ways:
1. Refer to the code structure and README template of already adapted robots, complete adaptation development according to integration type (ROS1/ROS2/Dora);
2. Add the adaptation code to the main repository's `robodriver/robots/` directory (naming convention consistent with already adapted robots);
3. Ensure code standardization and complete documentation (including environment preparation, configuration steps, functional verification);
4. Submit code PR to the main repository's `dev` branch, and we will review and merge promptly.

Looking forward to enriching RoboDriver's robot ecosystem together with you! 🤝
